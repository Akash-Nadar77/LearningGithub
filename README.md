Just learning, How to use Github :)
<br>
M - Modified (to clear this --> We have to add --> then we have to commit ...)
<br>
U - Untracked --> Not yet tracked by git.. 
<br>
To solve U & M we have to add this ... ( command : git add index.html or git add . -->It adds everything if I use dot...)
<br>
stage : When a file is added it is called staged.. -- git add . 
<br>
commit : After stage ... ( Unchanged !) --> git commit -m "message"
<br>
Push command --> To push the changes done in Local - Remote (Command : git push origin main)
<br>
cd .. --> TO come out from the exisisting folder.
<br>
mkdir <filename> --> To create repo/files (Extra to make this local repo to remote repo use command : git init )
<br>
To push repo from local file - remote use : git remote add origin <link>
<br>
To verify remote - get remote -v
<br>
To verify branch : git branch
