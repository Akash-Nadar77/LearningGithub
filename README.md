# LearningGithub
Just try some new stuff before !! my course starts ..
<br>
Just learning, How to use Github :)
<br>
M - Modified (to clear this --> We have to add --> then we have to commit ...)
<br>
U - Untracked --> Not yet tracked by git.. 
<br>
To solve U & M we have to add this ... ( command : git add index.html or git add . -->It adds everything if I use dot...)
<br>
stage : When a file is added it is called staged..
<br>
commit : After stage ... ( Unchanged !)
<br>
Push command --> To push the changes done in Local - Remote (Command : git push origin main)
